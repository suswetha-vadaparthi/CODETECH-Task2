## OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
# PROJECT:To-Do List Web Application
## Objectives:
* The primary objective of this to-do list application is to help users manage and organize tasks by allowing them to:
* Create new tasks.
* Categorize tasks as "personal" or "business".
* Mark tasks as completed or edit and delete tasks as needed.
## Key Activities:
* Task Creation: Users input tasks with a description and categorize them as personal or business.
* Task Management: Users can mark tasks as completed, edit task details, or delete tasks.
* Data Persistence: The app saves tasks locally using localStorage, ensuring tasks persist across page reloads.
* User Personalization: Users can input their name for a personalized greeting each time they access the app.
## Technologies:
* The application is built using:
* HTML: For structuring the application layout and setting up key sections (e.g., task list, task creation form).
* CSS: For styling and providing visual themes, with customized colors for different task categories (e.g., personal and business).
* JavaScript: For functionality, including task addition, category selection, marking tasks as completed, editing tasks, and storing user data using localStorage.
